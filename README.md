# ðŸš€ ROS 2 Skills Showcase

Welcome to my **ROS 2 Skills Showcase** repository! This project demonstrates my understanding and practical application of the core concepts of **ROS 2**, as learned in the course. In this repository, you will find various examples, including:

- **ROS 2 Installation** and Workspace setup
- Development of **ROS 2 Nodes**, **Topics**, **Services**, and **Custom Messages**
- Working with **ROS 2 Parameters** and **Launch Files**
- **Simulation and Real-World Applications** built with ROS 2

## ðŸ“š Key Concepts Practiced

In this repository, I have showcased a variety of essential **ROS 2** concepts:

### 1. **ROS 2 Installation and Workspace Setup**
   - Installed and configured **ROS 2** in a workspace.
   - Set up multiple ROS 2 packages within the workspace for project-specific tasks.

### 2. **ROS 2 Nodes**
   - Developed **ROS 2 nodes** to perform various tasks such as controlling robotic systems and processing data.

### 3. **ROS 2 Topics**
   - Created **ROS 2 topics** for asynchronous communication between nodes.
   - Implemented publisher and subscriber systems to exchange data between nodes.

### 4. **ROS 2 Services**
   - Designed **ROS 2 services** to handle synchronous communication between nodes for request-response patterns.
   - Example services like starting and stopping a robot's motion or querying status.

### 5. **ROS 2 Custom Messages**
   - Developed **custom ROS 2 messages** to communicate complex data between nodes.
   - This includes defining new message types that fit specific use cases.

### 6. **ROS 2 Parameters**
   - Worked with **ROS 2 parameters** to configure nodes at runtime without changing the source code.
   - Examples of setting parameters dynamically for various robot configurations and control parameters.

### 7. **ROS 2 Launch Files**
   - Created **ROS 2 launch files** to simplify running and managing multiple nodes and their configurations.
   - These launch files allow for easy setup of robots and sensors in a simulation or real-world application.
